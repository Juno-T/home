Hi! I am a graduate student at professor Iba's laboratory, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo. At the laboratory, I do research on developing **Reinforcement Learning** algorithm. I am also interested and experienced in other fields of **AI** such as computer vision, machine learning in general and their applications.
